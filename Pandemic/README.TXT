PROJECT TITLE: Joe's pandemic project
PURPOSE OF PROJECT 
This is some java code I've written in BlueJ to try and simulate the boardgame pandemic (or at least a simplified version of it).

It should when ran create a game with a few players who will make automatic choices about what to do until the game is either won or lost.

VERSION or DATE:
15 April 2019.

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
Running PandemicGame.java after all the files have been compiled should work if the cities.csv file can be located.


AUTHORS: Joe Salmon

USER INSTRUCTIONS: You will need to play around with the location of the file "cities.csv" I think to get the program to find it.
