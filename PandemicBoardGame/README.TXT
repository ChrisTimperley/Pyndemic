#Pandemic Board Game Readme

##What is this?

This is a simple project I've started to help me learn how to use vim, java and github. When it's finished it should let somebody play the Pandemic board game as one or more of the players.

I'm about to start an OU degree in computing and IT and hoping for a career in IT eventually. The role I've got my eye on is one of full stack developer https://www.sitepoint.com/full-stack-developer/, although I understand this might already be old hat https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/08/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-full-stack-developer/. So I'm going to try to learn as much code as I can and focus on completing practical fun projects with other people alongside my course. 


##What am I trying to learn?

I'd like to get my head round java, Python, SQL, and anything else relevant to make this work. I think that probably includes Git and how to use the command line in Linux (running Ubuntu at the moment). In the future I'd also like to learn

At least one kind of web server language, probably two (Apache, PHP I think)
At least one version of SQL
Some basic front end website languages (HTML, JavaScript and the like)


##Whats the plan?
I've had a think about the objects which I'll need to makes classes for, having hopefully gained a better understanding of classes and object orientated programming since I last looked at this. Below is a list of the classes I'm thinking of trying to write.

###PandemicGame 
This will be the class that brings everything together consisting of the below
####Attributes
* GamePlayer
* CardDeck
* InfectionCubes
* GameBoard
####Methods
* Setters & Getters for each attribute


###GamePlayer
This will be the class that either users interact with or is controlled by an AI trying to play the game consisting of
####Attributes
* CardsInHand
* Actions
####Methods
* Setters & Getters for each attribute


###InfectDeck
This will be the class
