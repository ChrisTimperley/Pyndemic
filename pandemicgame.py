# This file contains four classes:

# 1: startinggame - This class contains all the defs which preform the 
# actions needed to set up the game, although it does utilise actions 
# found in other classes.

# 2: inaturn - This class contains all the defs which carry out the 
# most basic and simple actions that are completed in a turn, such as 
# moving a player or drawing a card.

# 3: playeraction - This class contains all the defs for the eight 
# different player actions that can be completed in a turn. These are
# covered by nine different defs as sharing knowledge requires a def
# for giving a card and a def for taking a card.

# 4: game - This class contains all the defs which the players interact
# with to play the game. It should only require defs found in the
# playeraction class, and does not interact directly with the .db file
# which contains the game information.

# A list of all the defs found in each class and how they work can be
# found in readme.md.
